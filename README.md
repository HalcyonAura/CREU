### Weekly CREU Updates

Hi there, my name is Cecilia La Place and this page will be used for required weekly updates for the CREU program. This repo also will house any code we might develop. 

# 9/3-9/9 - Week 1
Our first few meetings up to this point have focused on administrative tasks for the CREU but also understanding the scope of the research project. Professor Bansal gave us materials and tutorials to look through to familiarize ourselves with the topics ahead. We looked through the following titles and topics: Semantic Web Revisited, Linked Data, ETL Framework for Big Data Integration, XML, RDF. I intend to return to these topics to gain a better understanding during a second or third read-though next week.
# 9/10-16 - Week 2
While I have a very surface level understanding of our topics, I'm becoming more comfortable with looking into them. My prior research experience makes me inclined to delve deep into a large variety of papers. At our meeting this week, Professor Bansal was cautious to warn that such an approach would be hard given how deep the topics go and how high level the papers are at this point. She mentioned she would compile a list of papers she felt would be an appropriate start. At least I have an idea of what conferences and journals to look at once we pick up speed. We've also made a tentative plan to have online storage for the papers we read and find. Truthfully though, I don't think I'll have time this week to go through anything in depth due to career fair both on Tempe and the Polytechnic campus which will set me behind in two days of classes. I was at least able to take a look through google scholar on knowledge representation, big data, and linked data and open some links. I intend to read those in my free time. Unfortunately a lot of the papers I found were very high level and I questioned their relation to our focus given the diverse topics
# 9/17-9/23 - Week 3
This week Professor Bansal gave us 7-8 more papers to give us a better starting point in regards to understanding the project. I've been having some difficulty getting through them due to the dense nature of the topic but I've been also reading them over a few times and taking notes after the initial read through. I've been trying to dedicate a half hour or an hour to sitting down and reading/taking notes throughout the week until I get overwhelmed and then come back to it later. It's been helping me get through them but I feel at times the concepts are too easy to understand and that I'm missing something key--hence why I've gone back over them a few more times. I've even pulled in the papers given to us at the beginning to see if I can connect the concepts there to make sure I understand. I hope to get to the tutorials given to us by this weekend as well but I'm also preparing to go to GHC (studying for technical interviews) so my focus has been mostly on the papers and will likely be there for this week.
# 9/24-9/30 - Week 4
After our meeting this week I was asked to mention the connections I'd built from the papers to our project. From the paper about Clinga, I found it interesting their methods of data analysis through the form of SVM (support vector machines). I've briefly worked with them in my summer REU research program. From the paper about Food in Open Data, I felt it was a particularly relevant paper on the grounds of what if we need to remake or add on to an existing ontology. Furthermore, I think this paper shows the possibilities that open up as a result of open big data--such as mobile or web applications. In the paper about soil ontologies, this cemented the idea of using existing big data sources, but also adding on to them, or reformatting them. Directly considering the project, this data source is also something to consider or at least use as a springboard. We may want to consider soil properties, or perhaps building code and ability as a part of neighborhood sustainability. e.g. A home built on poor soil may have poor stability. In regards to showing an application of our potential work (this being related to work near the end of the year), the paper on illegally parked bikes in Tokyo, and the paper concerning MOOC's being available all at once in a contained source, show and detail possible ways to reach out to the public whether through cooperation or use. I spent this week focusing on what neighborhood sustainability could be in the context of our project. We should look at what sustainability is, and perhaps in the context of a few papers or existing implementations such as the United Nations or general community definitions in the US. (http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/160/1/012046/meta, http://www.crcworks.org/guide.pdf). From there we might have to narrow our project to focus on specific types of data (e.g. transportation was something we discussed in this week's meeting), or find a way to incorporate things piece by piece. I likened it to building a "neighborhood" out of our data. There's honestly a lot to consider...
# 9/31-10/7 - Week 5
While I was out at the Grace Hopper Celebration for 3 days and traveling for 1, I spent some of my time at GHC observing other undergradutes' research posters, going to research related presentations and more. While it was for my CRA-W GHC Research Scholars program, I did enjoy it. I found myself looking for instances in which big data appeared or was useful, whether in research or companies. There were a few companies that focused on security of data, or simply hosting multitudes of data, but there were also companies that managed that data which I found intriguing, (I'll revise this to mention those companies as I don't remember their names right now). From the presentations, I wondered how the presenters were managing multitudes of data and in most cases found it was an algorithm or forays into machine learning/etc. or drawn from trends that appeared. I'm not sure if we'll have statistical needs because most of the algorithms were implemented in Python and R and usually numerically based analysis. There's more analysis on the posters I saw to be done... Prior to leaving though I spent some time going through the tutorials posted on XML and OWL.

# 10/8-10/14
This week I compiled all the documents we had been given into a spreadsheet to make it easier for when we do the paper writing process at the end. The papers had sections indicating their year of publication, title, authors, main contributions, and topics covered. I also included a section for their citation so we don't have to worry about that either, but I wanted to confirm the format we would be using before I did so. I then compiled some links on sustainability that Vatricia had found and put those in (and their unique definitions) to another page so as we define things or find things we want to define using other sources, we can add those. Another tab went to technologies we had been given and some I had found out about through my recent meetups. This past Saturday I attended a meetup that had a variety of tech sessions and took note of some of the big data applications they mentioned such as Spark structured streamline and ember. While I looked more into ember than spark, it still made me realize we needed a dedicated page for how we might go about visualizing the data we have. Pre-emptively, I made a section for datasets as well. Knowing which ones we're using, how to download them, etc. is incredibly important. While the work that went in seems a little too early, my previous research experience is what was driving me to do this. My first paper I didn't remember all the papers I'd gone through and had to refind new sources to still convey the same idea that had been formulated by other papers. For my second paper I needed to understand the technologies I was using and having a compiled list of places to refer to, teach myself, and more was super helpful. This spreadsheet was more to help us in the long run and also create an easy way for us to find what we need without having to waste time rereading/re-finding/etc things or find ourselves scrambling in an unorganized fashion. I wanted to encourage the eventual quality of whatever we might do. In any case, the spreadsheet is still not up to date as it has some blanks and some applications that need research done on them. I do still think it was a decent attempt to promote organzation.

# 10/15-10/21
It is midterm week, but I still am trying to devote some time to catching up the spreadsheet and finding more things to add to it technology wise.
