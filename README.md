### Weekly CREU Updates

Hi there, my name is Cecilia La Place and this page will be used for required weekly updates for the CREU program. This repo also will house any code we might develop. 

# 9/7 - Week 1
Our first few meetings up to this point have focused on administrative tasks for the CREU but also understanding the scope of the research project. Professor Bansal gave us materials and tutorials to look through to familiarize ourselves with the topics ahead. We looked through the following titles and topics: Semantic Web Revisited, Linked Data, ETL Framework for Big Data Integration, XML, RDF. I intend to return to these topics to gain a better understanding during a second or third read-though next week.
# 9/14 - Week 2
While I have a very surface level understanding of our topics, I'm becoming more comfortable with looking into them. My prior research experience makes me inclined to delve deep into a large variety of papers. At our meeting this week, Professor Bansal was cautious to warn that such an approach would be hard given how deep the topics go and how high level the papers are at this point. She mentioned she would compile a list of papers she felt would be an appropriate start. At least I have an idea of what conferences and journals to look at once we pick up speed. We've also made a tentative plan to have online storage for the papers we read and find. Truthfully though, I don't think I'll have time this week to go through anything due to career fair both on Tempe and the Polytechnic campus which will set me behind in two days of classes. 
# 9/21 - Week 3

# 9/28 - Week 4
