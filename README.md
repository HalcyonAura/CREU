### Weekly Updates

# 9/1 - Week 0
Hi there, my name is Cecilia La Place and this page will be used for required weekly updates for the CREU program. This repo also will house any code we might develop. This week we focused on finishing administrative tasks for the program as well as meeting to make sure we understand our project's possible paths. 

# 9/7 - Week 1
For this week I finished up the remaining administrative tasks remaining as well as introduced myself to the following titles and topics: Semantic Web Revisited, Linked Data, ETL Framework for Big Data Integration, XML, RDF. I intend to return to these topics to gain a better understanding during a second or third read-though next week.
