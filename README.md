### Weekly CREU Updates

Hi there, my name is Cecilia La Place and this page will be used for required weekly updates for the CREU program. This repo also will house any code we might develop. 

# 9/3-9/9 - Week 1
Our first few meetings up to this point have focused on administrative tasks for the CREU but also understanding the scope of the research project. Professor Bansal gave us materials and tutorials to look through to familiarize ourselves with the topics ahead. We looked through the following titles and topics: Semantic Web Revisited, Linked Data, ETL Framework for Big Data Integration, XML, RDF. I intend to return to these topics to gain a better understanding during a second or third read-though next week.
# 9/10-16 - Week 2
While I have a very surface level understanding of our topics, I'm becoming more comfortable with looking into them. My prior research experience makes me inclined to delve deep into a large variety of papers. At our meeting this week, Professor Bansal was cautious to warn that such an approach would be hard given how deep the topics go and how high level the papers are at this point. She mentioned she would compile a list of papers she felt would be an appropriate start. At least I have an idea of what conferences and journals to look at once we pick up speed. We've also made a tentative plan to have online storage for the papers we read and find. Truthfully though, I don't think I'll have time this week to go through anything in depth due to career fair both on Tempe and the Polytechnic campus which will set me behind in two days of classes. I was at least able to take a look through google scholar on knowledge representation, big data, and linked data and open some links. I intend to read those in my free time. Unfortunately a lot of the papers I found were very high level and I questioned their relation to our focus given the diverse topics
# 9/17-9/23 - Week 3
This week Professor Bansal gave us 7-8 more papers to give us a better starting point in regards to understanding the project. I've been having some difficulty getting through them due to the dense nature of the topic but I've been also reading them over a few times and taking notes after the initial read through. I've been trying to dedicate a half hour or an hour to sitting down and reading/taking notes throughout the week until I get overwhelmed and then come back to it later. It's been helping me get through them but I feel at times the concepts are too easy to understand and that I'm missing something key--hence why I've gone back over them a few more times. I've even pulled in the papers given to us at the beginning to see if I can connect the concepts there to make sure I understand. I hope to get to the tutorials given to us by this weekend as well but I'm also preparing to go to GHC (studying for technical interviews) so my focus has been mostly on the papers and will likely be there for this week.
# 9/24-9/30 - Week 4
